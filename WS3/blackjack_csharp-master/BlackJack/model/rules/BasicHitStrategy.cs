/*
 * Design and implement a new rule variant for when the dealer should take one more card. 
 * The new variant is “Soft 17″, use the same design pattern already present for Hit. 
 * Soft 17 means that the dealer has 17 but in a combination of Ace and 6 (for example Ace, two, two, two). 
 * This means that the Dealern can get another card valued at 10 but still have 17 as the value of the ace is reduced to 1. 
 * Using the soft 17 rule the dealer should take another card 
 * (compared to the original rule when the dealer only takes cards on a score of 16 or lower).
 * 
 * 
 * New class Soft17HitStrategy : IHitStrategy           ???
 * Implement in RulesFactory
 * Double check against GameStrategy(classes) : INewGameStrategy
