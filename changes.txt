Changes implemented in patch 1.2

1. Removed undefined datatype from attributes after criticism.
2. I got criticized for deviating from domain-model naming conventions regarding Authentication calss beeing to software specific. 
Considering this and conventions about what is actually necessary/worthwhile to include in a strict domain-model I concluded removing the Athentication class completely would be the preferred solution.
My interpretation of the boat-club domain is that user authentication is a valid concetual part, but rather a design of how to implement distinguishable users and obtaining secure software solutions.
3. Added attribute for membership fee, since it is clearly stated in the problem description under primary actors and register boat use-case and therefore part of the requirements for passing grade 2.

Changes implemented in patch 1.3
Added noteworthy classes, associations and attributes regarding use case 2, 3, 7, 9, 13 and 14, and associations to classes in model 1.2. I tried to keep the model concise, 
not overextended or to detailed but enough to facilitate a conceptual understanding and to give a domain-overview. 
I intentionally left out supporting- and offstage actors in an attempt to delimit the model to the boat-club itself, not the domain of the boat-club and it's relations to other domains, regardless how important.

1. Divided CalendarEvent class into a Calendar class and Event class for SOC reasons.
2. Added BoatDescription class to differentiate between the physical boat and descriptions/data managed by the user and used in booking process.
3. Added Booking class to complete abstraction of booking-/assignment of berths.
